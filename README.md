# Dev Portfolio

This is the source for my personal website: [jerkeyray.com](https://jerkeyray.com)

It’s where I share my projects, write about what I’m learning, and keep track of things I’ve built or found useful.

The site will keep evolving as I do — new posts, updates, and experiments will keep showing up here.

Nothing fancy — just a space to stay consistent, document my journey, and build in public.
